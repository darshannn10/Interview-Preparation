# `SameSite` attribute

The `SameSite` attribute on cookies is a security feature designed to help prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks by controlling how cookies are sent with cross-site requests. It tells the browser under what conditions cookies should be sent along with requests to other websites.

The `SameSite` attribute can take three values:

1. **Strict**: The cookie will only be sent if the request is coming from the same site (origin) as the one that set the cookie. For example, if a user is on `siteA.com`, and `siteB.com` tries to make a request to `siteA.com`, the cookie won't be sent. This provides the highest level of security.
2. **Lax**: The cookie will be sent when navigating to the origin site (e.g., if you follow a link or perform a top-level navigation), but not with other types of cross-site requests, like those made by third-party scripts. It's more permissive than `Strict` but still provides some CSRF protection.
3. **None**: The cookie will be sent with all cross-site requests, regardless of the origin. This is the least restrictive option. However, when using `SameSite=None`, you must also set the `Secure` attribute, meaning the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS connections.

### Example of setting the `SameSite` attribute in HTTP headers:

```
Set-Cookie: my_cookie=value; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

### Why it matters:

- **CSRF Protection**: It prevents malicious websites from making unwanted requests on behalf of a user without their knowledge or consent.
- **Cross-site Behavior**: It helps websites control how their cookies are exposed to other sites, preventing misuse in cross-origin requests.
