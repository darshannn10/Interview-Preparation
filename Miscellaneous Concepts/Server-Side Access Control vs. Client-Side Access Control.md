# Server-Side Access Control vs. Client-Side Access Control

### Server-Side Access Control

Server-side access control is implemented on the server and is considered more secure. Key points:

- Enforced by the server, not easily bypassed by users
- Controls access to resources and functionality on the server
- Typically involves user authentication and authorization checks
- Not visible or modifiable by end-users
- More reliable and secure method of access control

### Client-Side Access Control

Client-side access control is implemented in the browser or client application. Important aspects:

- Executed on the user's device, can be bypassed or manipulated
- Often used for improving user experience (e.g., hiding UI elements)
- Not secure for protecting sensitive data or operations
- Can be easily circumvented by tech-savvy users
- Should always be complemented by server-side controls

### Key Differences

Understanding the distinctions between server-side and client-side access control is crucial:

- Security: Server-side is more secure; client-side is easily bypassed
- Implementation: Server-side on the server; client-side in the browser/app
- Reliability: Server-side is more reliable for enforcing security policies
- Visibility: Server-side logic is hidden; client-side is visible to users
- Use cases: Server-side for critical security; client-side for UI enhancements

In secure application design, it's crucial to implement robust server-side access controls and use client-side controls only for non-critical, user experience-related functions.
